## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
**NOTE**: These require templates to be passed down through props from an app in which these components should be rendered.

#### `npm run test`

Launches JEST over the repository.
Current snapshot tests requires `npm test -- -u` in order to update when all changes are final.

#### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `demo` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
